# xmbl_testnet
XMBL's Cubic Ledger Technology and Virtual Machine (testnet - alpha)

## Geometric Cryptography

XMBL uses a revolutionary 3D geometric coordinate system for transaction addressing and cryptographic proofs. Every transaction is assigned x, y, z coordinates and vectors relative to the system origin (first cube's middle block). This enables:

- **Fractal Addressing**: Completed cubes have coordinates relative to higher-dimensional cubes
- **Geometric Proofs**: Permission verification through coordinate relationships
- **Private Mapping**: Final coordinates encrypted with user's public key for secure transaction access
- **Scalable Structure**: Infinite hierarchical growth with consistent coordinate system

**TODO**: Implement encrypted message delivery mechanism in storage and compute module (xsc) for secure coordinate distribution to users.

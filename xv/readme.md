# XV - XMBL Visualizer

XMBL's Visualizer module.

This visualizer should track the system activity in real-time and present the 3js visualizations of the cubic constructions (main cube and partials), state machine, consensus mempools, storage use, and compute activities. it should also have a block explorer of txs based on hashes (and minimal information for zk proofs)
